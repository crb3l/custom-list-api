Ok, so I started this tutoril from react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial to accomodate myself with React, instead of relying on my pseudo-knowledge aqcuired from working with react for over a year in a team of 4 colleagues: Me, Claudiu, GigelPT and Gemeni.

They were helpful, alas bad use of coding syntax. Now I have to separate my ways and rely on my own knowledge as well.
